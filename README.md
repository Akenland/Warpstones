# Warpstones
A Bukkit plugin for a uniquely immersive warping system, based around floating structures known as Warpstones.

Warpstones allow players to fast-travel to previously visited locations, marked with floating lapis and store structures. Inspired by “save points” in many older video games, and designed to encourage exploration, players can return to their saved warpstones. No commands are required for players, keeping players immersed in the game.

# Features
## The Warpstone
These floating lapis and stone structures can be activated by players to save their location. Players can return to their last saved warpstone at any time with commands (if enabled) or from another warpstone.

A home warpstone can also be saved, allowing for a persistent saved warpstone near a player’s home.

Warpstones can be generated in a variety of biome-specific styles and sizes, and their behavior is highly customizable.

## Unique Items
Occasionally when activating new warpstones, some Warp Dust may fall into your hands. This dust can be crafted into Shards, which can then be linked to any warpstone.

Linked shards are items that allow warping to the warpstone they’re linked to, even if the user doesn’t have the warpstone saved. A survival-friendly way to save multiple warp locations, shards are valuable and useful.

Future updates will add rare items to allow players to slowly grow their own warpstones.

## Teleportation
The plugin also includes intelligently-designed teleportation commands (/tp and /tphere). The commands can be configured to require requests, have a maximum distance, and delays that increase if the player is in combat.

Visual and sound effects provide an additional immersive feel, and notify nearby players that someone may be teleporting to or from their location, useful for PvP.

## Add-Ons
Augment the behavior of Warpstones to suit your server’s gameplay, or even overhaul it entirely with a unique game mode based around warpstones.

Capture the Warpstone is available as a demonstration of what Warpstone add-ons are capable of. With it, players can capture warpstones of behalf of their realm, allowing only their allies to use it. Battle over warpstones to protect your realm’s ability to use it!

If you are a server owner, custom add-ons can be requested for a small price, details coming soon. If you are a developer, documentation for creating your own add-ons will be available soon.
